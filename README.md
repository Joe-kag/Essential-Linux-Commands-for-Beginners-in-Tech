# Essential-Linux-Commands-for-Beginners-in-Tech


1\. Linux is a powerful and flexible OS, widely used for its robust command-line tools. Whether you're handling files, navigating directories, or monitoring systems, mastering key commands is essential. Here's a quick guide to some of the most useful Linux commands with practical examples.

**File and Directory Operations**\
These core commands let you create, navigate, and manage files and folders—essential for efficient system use.


2\. `ls` **— List Directory Contents**\
Use `ls` to view files and directories. Add `-a` to show hidden files and `-l` for detailed info like permissions and ownership.

ls -la /path/to/directory
